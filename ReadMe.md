# Customizable POD T-shirt Store (Lit + Vite + Three.js)

This project is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built using **Lit Web Components**. It allows users to customize Print-on-Demand (POD) products like T-shirts, hoodies, and caps with 3D previews, image uploads, and text input.  
 **Live Demo:** [https://imageuploader-97k.pages.dev]
**Github Repo** [https://github.com/bablichoudhary/ImageUploader.git]

## Assignment Overview

### Part 1: SPA Conversion Using Lit

- The original UI inspiration was from [tympanus.net's RepeatingImageTransition](https://tympanus.net/Development/RepeatingImageTransition/).
- This was converted into a **SPA** using Lit and Vite.
- All features like image upload, product selection, and previews are handled without page reloads.
- **Routing** was configured using `@vaadin/router`, though the app is currently single-page.
- **State management** was handled via reactive properties in Lit components.
